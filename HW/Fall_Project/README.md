# ABOUT MY FALL PROJECT
Because of too many assignments and exams of other courses and the lack of good-quality soldering equipment, I could not complete the project well as I planned.

- The Arduino sketches are so amateur, the software part was developed at the last night quickly. Also, when I went to the class for the in-class demo, the demo was not working so I manipulated the code and removed the verification used for the data link, as a solution :) Please do not use my sketches, code them from the scratch.
- The example of AppDesigner can be a good starting point for beginners. It is so basic and a good example of serial communication.
